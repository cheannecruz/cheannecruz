<h2>Background: A Need for Guidance and Assistance</h2>

As the number of international students increases over time, there is also an increasing demand for an adequate amount of guidance and proper assistance. Being an international student has its fair share of challenges, including moving to a new country, coping up to a new environment, and dealing with stress. All of these can take a toll on a student's well being.

To investigate this further, our team interviewed several international students. Through this, we were able to shed some light on their situation and determine their pain-points.

<h2>User Persona and Journey Map</h2>

After conducting user interviews, we were able to determine our user persona. Creating the user persona helped us understand our target user's goals, expectations, and frustrations.

We also made a User Journey Map as an overview of what international students have to go through when they are transitioning to a new country and university. Through this, we're able to identify their pain-points.
